    "`HF_BatchTransform` was inspired by this [article](http://dev.fast.ai/tutorial.transformers). It handles both the tokenization and numericalization traditionally split apart in the fastai text DataBlock API. For huggingface tokenizers that require a prefix space, it will be included automatically. In its current incarnation, `HF_BatchTransform` can be used to tokenize multiple inputs (common in seq2seq models for tasks like summarization) and even apply different tokenizers and arguments to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs can come in as a string or a list of tokens, the later being for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), where you want to predict the label of each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The previous version of the library performed the tokenization/numericalization as a type transform when the raw data was read, and included a couple batch transforms to prepare the data for collation (e.g., to be made into a mini-batch). With this update, everything is done in a single batch transform.  Why?  Part of the inspiration had to do with the mechanics of the huggingrace tokenizer, in particular how by default it returns a collated mini-batch of data given a list of sequences. And where do we get a list of examples with fastai? In the batch transforms!  So I thought, hey, why not do everything dynamically at batch time?  And with a bit of tweaking, I got everything to work pretty well.  The result is less code, faster mini-batch creation, less RAM utilization and time spent tokenizing (really helps with very large datasets), and more flexibility."

The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is som...   \n",

For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Every character was a stereotype.

If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've alr...   \n",

It's warm and gooey, but you're not sure if it feels right. Try as I might, no matter how warm and gooey Raising Victor Vargas became I was always aware that something didn't quite feel right. Victor Vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director's part. Apparently, the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a Latino family on the lower east side, and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof. He was right, but it didn't fool me. Raising Victor Vargas is the story about a seventeen-year old boy called, you guessed it, Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk) who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the Rolling Stones could do in all the years they've toured. The movie starts off in `Ugly Fat' Donna's bedroom where Victor is sure to seduce her, but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best-friend Harold (Kevin Rivera) comes-a-looking for him. Caught in the attempt by Harold and his sister, Victor Vargas runs off for damage control. Yet even with the embarrassing implication that he's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood, nothing dissuades young Victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat. On a hot, New York City day they make way to the local public swimming pool where Victor's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph Judy (Judy Marte), who's not just pretty, but a strong and independent too. The relationship that develops between Victor and Judy becomes the focus of the film. The story also focuses on Victor's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita (Altagracia Guzman), his brother Nino (also played by real life brother to Victor, Silvestre Rasuk) and his sister Vicky (Krystal Rodriguez). The action follows Victor between scenes with Judy and scenes with his family. Victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp-daddy, his feelings for Judy and his grandmother's conservative Catholic upbringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems that arise from Raising Victor Vargas are a few, but glaring errors. Throughout the film you get to know certain characters like Vicky, Nino, Grandma,</td>\n",

Strange, after 20-odd years in the business. He was probably never much good at narrative, just hid it well inside \"edgy\" projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this excuses him this present, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, \"two parts of Che don't (even) make a whole\". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epic biopic in name only, Che(2008) barely qualifies as a feature film! It certainly has no legs, inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history, Soderbergh's 4.5hrs-long dirge just goes nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving of Australia's At The Movies duo, noted about Soderbergh's repetitious waste of (HD digital storage): \"you're in the woods...you're in the woods...you're in the woods...\". I too am surprised Soderbergh didn't give us another 2.5hrs of THAT somewhere between his existing two Parts, because he still left out massive chunks of Che's \"revolutionary\" life! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure, Soderbergh unaccountably alienates, if not deliberately insults, his audiences by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. never providing most of Che's story; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. barely developing an idea, or a character; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. remaining claustrophobically episodic; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. ignoring proper context for scenes---whatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. linguistically</td>\n",

He's in charge of towing.\\n\\nThe City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).\\n\\nLed by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.\\n\\nIt is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to \"compensate\" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.\\n\\nPortland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.\\n\\nSenator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall.

We, on the other hand, will be getting odd commentaries like this one, that compares the barbarism of the Cheney, Bush, Rumsfeld era with a shouting match. \\nAnger and despair sound loud and usually involve bad grammar and insults. I, for one, think this election is all about the chaos and cacophony of a people waking to the fact their leaders have let privileged characters loot the treasury and enrich themselves as the poor die. \\nAs for me, Trump's insults and accurate comments on the W. war were about the only genuine part of the discussion.\\nHugh Massengill, Eugene</td>\n",
