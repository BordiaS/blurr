The first \"Stoke Mandeville Games\" were organized in 1948 to coincide with the London Olympics, the second to be held in Britain. Named for the hospital in Buckinghamshire where Prof. Ludwig Guttmann's pioneering spinal injuries unit was based, the competitors in those initial Games -- 14 men and two women -- took part in a wheelchair archery contest. Many were military veterans injured on the battlefields of World War II. Just a year later, six teams competed at Stoke Mandeville -- with wheelchair netball, a forerunner of wheelchair basketball, being introduced -- as sport became a central part of a rehabilitation process that had been revolutionized by Guttmann. In 1956, a \"statement of intent\" was unveiled for the Games, which were by this time international, according to to the Mandeville Legacy website run by the local authority. It read: \"The aim of the Stoke Mandeville Games is to unite paralyzed men and women from all parts of the world in an international sports</td>\n",

That's how long it's been since 227 passengers and 12 crew members boarded Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, destined for Beijing. A routine trip, it seemed, to catch up relatives in time for the weekend, start on a work assignment or just get away. Where they got to, still unknown. An exhaustive search -- covering a mind-boggling 2.97 million square miles, which is nearly the size of the continental United States -- has yielded some clues, but no proof of where the Boeing 777 is or definitively what happened to it. The latest, most notable lead revolved around two large objects detected by satellite Sunday floating on waters over 1,400 miles off of Australia's west coast. The first of several Australian military planes, as well as two long-range commercial jets, resumed their search Saturday morning to find any trace of the objects, amid some skepticism that they or ships in the area ever will and, if they do, that whatever they find will be related to the missing aircraft. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Friday defended the decision to announce the find, saying Australia owes it to families of those missing \"to give them information as soon as it's</td>\n",

As new details emerge, here is a look at basic questions about the tragedy:. Was the plane shot down? All evidence so far says yes. President Barack Obama declared Friday that a surface-to-air missile blasted the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 on Thursday over the Donetsk region of Ukraine near the Russian border. According to a senior American official, a U.S. radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before plane went down. A second system saw a heat signature, which would indicate a missile rising from the ground into the air at the time the airliner was hit, the official explained. Does anyone dispute that? Not at this point. While the Ukrainian government trades accusations of blame with pro-Russian rebels it is fighting in eastern Ukraine and Russia itself, no one has offered evidence of an alternative theory. The plane's debris field indicates a mid-air explosion. Who did it? A preliminary classified U.S. intelligence analysis concludes the rebels most likely fired the missile, according to an American defense official with direct access to the latest information. \"Evidence indicates that the plane was shot</td>\n",
