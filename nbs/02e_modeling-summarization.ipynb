That's Deb Koma, who visited once as a child and walked back into the Magic Kingdom in the mid-1990s with her young son. \"It was so perfect, everybody was so happy, everything was so maintained,\" said Koma, who now works for the AllEars.net, an unofficial Disney planning and fan site. \"You were in a perfect fantasy world. That, and my little boy loved it.\" But for other vacationers, Disney inspires a firm \"no.\" To those travelers, Disney is merely a commercial machine built to sell tickets, overpriced toys and a stereotype of girls as princesses.
