Errand Frazier of Vero Beach wasn't quite sure what to do at first when he heard purring coming from his Chevy pickup, parked outside his house in late May. He couldn't see anything and wasn't sure exactly where it was, or even what type of animal was in there. So, he left an open can of cat food under one of the tires and set up a camera to try to get to the bottom of it. When he came back the next morning, the food was gone, but there was nothing on the video, he said. Thinking he had lost his mind, he went on an impromptu fishing trip to clear his head. When he got to the canal, the purring started again. Taking matters into his own hands, he reached for his toolbox, took out some sheet metal cutters and cut back the metal on the side of the truck bed. As he peeled it back, he spotted a kitten. \"I seen this little rascal peeking at me,\" Frazier recalled. \"I said, 'What in the world? You hitched a ride!'\" Frazier hadn't thought anything of slicing into his truck. He and his wife, Cindy, have a dog and two cats, and care deeply about animals. In the past, Frazier said, he has rescued stray kittens and brought them to the local Humane Society. Frazier could see that the cat was under the bed of his truck, lodged in the frame, and he couldn't get to it. Unsure what to do, he sought advice from the Humane Society of Vero Beach and Indian River County. Driving slowly, avoiding any bumps in the road, he reached the society's animal shelter and approached a staff member. \"I said, 'Ma'am, there's a kitten that hitchhiked from my home and I can't get it,\"\" Frazier said. \"She said, 'Man, you did a job on your truck.'\" It was a team rescue. Humane Society staff member Tonya Martinez got under Frazier's truck to try to move the kitten forward, while staff member Maria Valencia put on gloves to catch the kitty and animal care supervisor Robyn Krajewski stood ready with a special carrier, said Janet Winikoff, director of education at the local Humane Society, who posted the story on CNN iReport.

But his career path soon changed after joining the school's basketball team. Mutombo would go on to play in the NBA for 18 years and become one of the league's all-time best defensive players. Mutombo has always been involved in humanitarian work, particularly through the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation. He has been involved with CNN Heroes since 2007, when he served on the Blue Ribbon Panel that selects the top Heroes of the year. Mutombo recently sat down with CNN producer Allison Blakely to talk about Heroes and his philanthropy. Below are excerpts from that interview. Allison Blakely: What was your inspiration for starting the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation? Dikembe Mutombo: After traveling so much in Africa, doing some work for different organizations, we [had] witnessed so much suffering and pain. The Democratic Republic of Congo [has suffered] more than 10 years of civil unrest, where more than 5.3 million people have died. People have [called it] the World War III of Africa. (shakes his head) People are left with nothing. I decided to create the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation to change the living condition of my people in Africa. Blakely: You originally intended to be a doctor. Now you've built a hospital in your homeland. Tell me about it. Mutombo: [It] was my [hope] in building a hospital to let people know that things can be much better in the future.... The Old Testament says, \"People perish because of lack of education,\" and that's what we are trying to do. It's through education we will reduce the mortality rate: telling those moms how they can keep their babies away from mosquitoes, how they can get their baby vaccinated and deliver the baby in better circumstances. There was a woman that delivered a premature baby; I think that baby was like the size of my hands. We were the only hospital that was well-equipped with the high technology. The baby was able to grow stronger until it was able to go home. To see that child every time I go home is like I gave life to somebody. I think each one of us in this world, we have a duty to fulfill our mission. God has blessed some of us in the position to touch many people, and so many people can hear our voices from distances away</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Danish driver Allan Simonsen died in a high-speed crash at the famous Le Mans 24 Hour endurance race, organizers said Saturday. Simonsen, 34, one of the most experienced sports car drivers in the world, was competing for Aston Martin in the GTE-Am class. He was at the wheel -- less than 10 minutes into the race -- when his car left the circuit on the Tertre Rouge corner and crashed heavily into the safety barriers. Simonsen was immediately treated at the scene before being taken to the circuit's medical center where he died shortly afterwards, officials said. \"The Automobile Club de l'Ouest wishes to express its great sadness following this incident, and extends its deepest condolences to the family and those close to Allan Simonsen,\" read a statement. Simonsen was competing for the seventh time in the Le Mans 24-race and his teammates were fellow Danes Christoffer Nygaard and Kristian Poulsen. The trio had won their class in the season opener for the World Endurance Championship at Silverstone and claimed pole position for Le Mans in their category in qualifying earlier this week. After the accident, the race was halted for an hour before resuming with Simonsen's Aston Martin teammates -- they have five entries -- still racing despite the tragedy. \"At the specific request of his family, the team will continue to participate in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in tribute to Allan,\" read a statement on the official Aston Martin Racing website. \"On behalf of all of us at Aston Martin Racing, I would like to extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the individuals, and families whose friends or loved ones were involved in today's terrible tragedy,\" said the team's managing director John Gaw. Formula One star Jenson Button gave his reaction on Twitter: \"Allan Simonsen RIP.such a tragic loss. A true fighter &amp; a true racer. Safety is something we need 2 improve on in Motorsport.\" This year's Le Mans marks the 90th anniversary of the race and its 81st edition on the Circuit de la Sarthe, which is situated two hours south west of of the French capital Paris.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Winter-weary residents in the Great Plains are bracing for yet another blow this week, compliments of a system that spent Sunday pounding those in and around Denver with high winds and heavy snow. The Colorado capital had already gotten over 8 inches of snow by 5:30 p.m. MT (7:30 p.m. ET). The snow socked the city's main airport, where more than 200 of 1,500 flights had been canceled and other travelers faced average delays of more than 4 hours on Sunday night, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Even more snow had fallen in other places, including 19 inches in Jefferson, about 70 miles southwest of Denver. By Sunday night, the worst was over for much of Colorado, though not for points east, which are expected to be hammered to start the workweek. That includes several Plains states, which are already reeling from a dizzying few days of harsh winter weather. Last Thursday, for instance, a storm dumped up to 22 inches of snow on parts of Kansas. Two days later, Teresa Moore said her street in Kansas City, Kansas, still hadn't been plowed, making it impossible for her to take her husband to his doctor's appointments or visit her son at the hospital. \"If we have an emergency or a fire, the rescue can't come down here. So what are we to do,\" Moore told CNN affiliate KCTV. \"... It just doesn't make any sense.\" She got some relief when plow trucks finally hit the roads around her home later Saturday, but it won't last long. That city is expecting 9 to 15 inches of snow Monday night into Tuesday. Forecasters have upped their predictions for the amount of snow expected in northwest Oklahoma to 8 to 10 inches, with 15 inches in spots. This may be a shock to some, given that temperatures in places reached the mid-60s on Sunday. \"May see 4-6 foot drifts!\" wrote National Weather Service meteorologist Rick Smith on Twitter. \"Traveling is beyond discouraged!\" Such forecasts raised alarms throughout the Plains, leading to crowded stores as residents prepared for the storm. Amanda Roberts, an entrepreneur and blogger in Warrensburg, Missouri, was one of them. Writing on Twitter, she said she made out well in her preparations. \"The snow has everyone stocking up on groceries,\" she said. \"Fresh produce is basically gone but i got the last gallon of chocolate milk. I call it a win.\" Record-setting February. Kansas City International Airport set</td>\n",
