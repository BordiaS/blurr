       "      <td>Raising Victor Vargas: A Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, Raising Victor Vargas is like sticking your hands into a big, steaming bowl of oatmeal. It's warm and gooey, but you're not sure if it feels right. Try as I might, no matter how warm and gooey Raising Victor Vargas became I was always aware that something didn't quite feel right. Victor Vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director's part. Apparently, the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a Latino family on the lower east side, and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof. He was right, but it didn't fool me. Raising Victor Vargas is the story about a seventeen-year old boy called, you guessed it, Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk) who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the Rolling Stones could do in all the years they've toured. The movie starts off in `Ugly Fat' Donna's bedroom where Victor is sure to seduce her, but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best-friend Harold (Kevin Rivera) comes-a-looking for him. Caught in the attempt by Harold and his sister, Victor Vargas runs off for damage control. Yet even with the embarrassing implication that he's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood, nothing dissuades young Victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat. On a hot, New York City day they make way to the local public swimming pool where Victor's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph Judy (Judy Marte), who's not just pretty, but a strong and independent too. The relationship that develops between Victor and Judy becomes the focus of the film. The story also focuses on Victor's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita (Altagracia Guzman), his brother Nino (also played by real life brother to Victor, Silvestre Rasuk) and his sister Vicky (Krystal Rodriguez). The action follows Victor between scenes with Judy and scenes with his family. Victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp-daddy, his feelings for Judy and his grandmother's conservative Catholic upbringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems that arise from Raising Victor Vargas are a few, but glaring errors. Throughout the film you get to know certain characters like Vicky, Nino, Grandma,</td>\n",

       "      <td>This film sat on my Tivo for weeks before I watched it. I dreaded a self-indulgent yuppie flick about relationships gone bad. I was wrong; this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed-up libidos of New Yorkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The format is the same as Max Ophuls' \"La Ronde,\" based on a play by Arthur Schnitzler, who is given an \"inspired by\" credit. It starts from one person, a prostitute, standing on a street corner in Brooklyn. She is picked up by a home contractor, who has sex with her on the hood of a car, but can't come. He refuses to pay her. When he's off peeing, she answers his cell phone and takes a message. She runs away with his keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the story switches to the contractor, who pays a professional call on a rich, bored New York woman, who plays with him until he is aroused, then she pulls away. She tells him how desperate and unhappy she is; he tells her how beautiful she is, and lucky. As he is leaving, she asks if he would have sex with her. She sits on top of him, bounces up and down. This time he comes, the he leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends. Hubby (Robert) is talking business, wife (Ellen) is bored, and switches the subject to sex, and how often men and women think about it. Husband switches conversation to desert. Later, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to entice Robert into sex. Robert wants none of it, and puts on a jazz record. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert turns up the music; Ellen turns on the TV; Robert turns on another TV. Cacophony ensues. Ellen goes up on the roof, Robert joins her. Ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men, men other than Robert. Robert says that he too needs to experience men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We next follow Robert as he visits an artist, Martin, played by Steve Buscemi. I wish Buscemi could have more roles like this, where he is a sexy, smart, totally desirable guy. Robert praises Martin's work, much more than it deserves, promises to get it into a show. Martin is excited, until it turns out that Robert is speaking out of his groin, it</td>\n",

       "      <td>The trouble with the book, \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American man's way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, sets, and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from Japanese ways of thinking were the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie isn't about Japan or real geisha. It is a story about a few American men's mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it isn't about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes, but then why make it into an American fantasy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups, no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. Of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. And that is what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won her himself. Nobu didn't even bid. So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old-man stink, get his fingers all over her naked body?

I have not read Hickam's memoirs, but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. The film, directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick, records the story of teenager Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), beginning in October of 1957. It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. We see a images of a blue-gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company. One of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. A melancholy violin tune fades with this image. We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: October 5, 1957, Coalwood, West Virginia. Homer and his buddies, Roy Lee Cook (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), are talking about football tryouts. Football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. \"Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college,\" questions Homer. Roy Lee replies, \"They're also the only ones who get the girls.\" Homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman. Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky. Then he wants to build a rocket. \"I want to go into space,\" says Homer. After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's (Natalie Canerday) fence, Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen). Quentin asks Homer, \"What do you want to know about rockets?\" Homer quickly anwers, \"Everything.\" His science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Frieda Riley (Laura Dern) greatly supports Homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer's basement.

It is a story about a few American men's mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it isn't about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes, but then why make it into an American fantasy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups, no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. Of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. And that is what I mean about this movie. Why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won her himself. Nobu didn't even bid. So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old-man stink, get his fingers all over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's</td>\n",

I have not read Hickam's memoirs, but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. The film, directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick, records the story of teenager Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), beginning in October of 1957. It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. We see a images of a blue-gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company. One of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. A melancholy violin tune fades with this image. We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: October 5, 1957, Coalwood, West Virginia. Homer and his buddies, Roy Lee Cook (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), are talking about football tryouts. Football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. \"Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college,\" questions Homer. Roy Lee replies, \"They're also the only ones who get the girls.\" Homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman. Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky. Then he wants to build a rocket. \"I want to go into space,\" says Homer. After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's (Natalie Canerday) fence, Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen). Quentin asks Homer, \"What do you want to know about rockets?\" Homer quickly anwers, \"Everything.\" His science teacher at Big Creek High School, Miss Frieda Riley (Laura Dern) greatly supports Homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer's basement.

He's in charge of towing.\\n\\nThe City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).\\n\\nLed by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.\\n\\nIt is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to \"compensate\" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.\\n\\nPortland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.\\n\\nSenator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall.

       "      <td>I'm not a big fan of either, but I've seen both, if you can count the first three Star Wars movies and a random smattering of different Star Trek episodes as having seen them. \\n\\nOf course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. \\n\\nProduction values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine. \\n\\nI wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.</td>\n",

ALL developed nations have, with the lone exception of the US--- though Obamacare has taken us closer, much closer. \\nYou have challenges in finding workers---- but you did find them, didn't you? Perhaps something is wrong with your wage structure: pay more. \\nYour competitors also face the same challenges: the impact won't be on your business, alone. Higher wages mean more money for workers to spend-- at your business.\\nIn a nation where the largest employer is a warehousing chain (Walmart) and the other huge similar businesses employ massive numbers of workers, I'm sorry to tell you that a living wage is a necessity. \\nYou say you're not wealthy--- but that's a comparative term. How much does your paycheck work out to, per hour? \\nOn a personal note, you should take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself how much the well-being of your neighbors means to you--- or if they're just so many robots.</td>\n",
