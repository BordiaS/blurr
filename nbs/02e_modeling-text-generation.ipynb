       "      <td>(CNN) -- With just months to go before the presidential campaign ends all meaningful activity on Capitol Hill, members of Congress are struggling to move a few must-pass pieces of legislation. One of the most pressing is the highway bill, which Congress is considering this week. Not only does all federal funding for transportation depend on passing a bill by March 31; the highway trust fund itself is scheduled to go broke in 2013 and the deal in the making pays for only two years. This is essential national maintenance. Yet Congress is - you guessed it - gridlocked. We all know Washington is broken. What's less clear: Did it ever work better? If it did, what was different? What ingredients have been lost, and can we recapture them? One place to look, especially apt in this instance: The 1956 congressional debate that created the interstate highway system. The 1956 Federal Aid Highway Act was the health-care legislation of its day, an epic Washington battle. The pressure had been building for decades as the number of cars exploded. Traffic was a national nightmare. Many intercity roads were hardly passable, and most Americans recognized that new highways were essential to continue the unprecedented growth the country had been enjoying since the end of World War II. What no one could agree on was how to pay for the new system. The 1950s were a more consensual era, of course. Both Democrats and Republicans had wanted to nominate Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for president in 1952, and during the debate over the highway bill, his approval ratings rarely dipped below 70%. But that doesn't mean there were no disagreements. Opinion: What's wrong with Congress? It's not big enough. Ideological divisions were if anything sharper than they are today -- Republicans were the party of big business, Democrats the champions of the people and the New Deal. Elections were just as competitive, partisan jockeying just as intense. And the debate about how to pay for the highway system -- tolls, taxes, bonds or some other way -- wasn't just about money. It was about values - what kind of country we wanted to be. The debate built in intensity through the early '50s. There were blue-ribbon commissions, competing proposals, an array of shifting alliances and armies of lobbyists. The president's proposal and a rival Democratic plan were both shot down in early summer 1955. The main obstacles: truckers, motorists and the oil industry, all resisting new gasoline, tire and vehicle sales taxes. While the American Trucking Association worked behind the</td>\n",

The frozen creature reputed to be Bigfoot turned out to be made of rubber, an enthusaist reports. The initial promoter of two hikers' claim that they found the body of Bigfoot in Georgia said he has determined that the discovery was a hoax. The body turned out to be rubber, and the two men who claimed that they found it, Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, have admitted that it was a costume, said a posting Tuesday on the Web sites of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. and Squatchdetective. The posting purportedly was written by Steve Kulls, who maintains the Squatchdetective Web site and hosts a similarly named Internet radio program, where the find was announced weeks ago. In addition, Stanford University anthropologist Richard Klein said Monday that he was not aware he had been identified as participating in the project and would not be involved in any effort to examine the purported Bigfoot carcass. Whitton and Dyer announced last week that they had found the body of a 7-foot-7-inch, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June. They said they put the carcass in a freezer and had spotted about three similar living creatures. \"We were not looking for Bigfoot,\" Whitton, a Clayton County, Georgia, police officer, said Friday during a news conference. \"We wouldn't know what we were doing if we did.\" He and Dyer insisted that scientific analysis would bear out their claim. The hoax was discovered after an \"expedited melting process,\" Kulls wrote. \"A break appeared up near the feet area... as the team and I began examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot which looked unnatural, reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot.\" Kulls said he contacted Tom Biscardi, the self-described \"Real Bigfoot Hunter\" who has been searching since 1971 for the creature of legend and appeared alongside Whitton and Dyer at the news conference. \"Later that day, Tom Biscardi informed us that both Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer admitted it was a costume,\" the posting said. Whitton and Dyer reportedly agreed to sign a promissory note and an admission of the hoax and meet with Biscardi at their hotel on Sunday. But when Biscardi went to the hotel, the two had left, Kull</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- As violence again roils Iraq, the United Nations reported more than 65,000 people had fled conflict areas in the past week. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a report that those Iraqis fled from the cities of Falluja and Ramadi in Iraq's central Anbar province. More than 140,000 people have been made homeless since new fighting broke out at the end of 2013, according to Iraq's Ministry of Displacement and Migration. It is the largest displacement in Iraq since the sectarian violence of 2006-2008. That figure adds to the 1.13 million people already internally displaced and mostly residing in Baghdad, Diyala and Ninewa provinces. Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the refugee agency, told reporters in Geneva that its staff and other people in Anbar had reported many civilians were unable to leave conflict-affected areas where food and fuel were in short supply. \"Most of the recently displaced remain outside Falluja city, accommodated by relatives or staying in schools, mosques and hospitals where resources are running low,\" he said. \"Host families are having difficulties sustaining the burden of caring for the displaced.\" More violence was recorded on Friday. Seven people were killed and nine others were hurt in separate incidents when Iraqi Army mortars landed in residential areas in Falluja, health officials there told CNN.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)The same superbug that contributed to two deaths in Los Angeles has been reported in North Carolina, where one person has died, a spokesman told CNN. Eighteen people have contracted carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, so far this year, said Kevin McCarthy, spokesman with the Carolinas HealthCare System. Of those, 15 had CRE upon admission to the hospital in Charlotte; three acquired it in the hospital, and one died, the spokesman said. The cause of death was not immediately clear. McCarthy declined to provide details on any of the patients. It was also not clear how any of them became infected. In Los Angeles, seven patients contracted CRE after routine endoscopic procedures. Two of them died, the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center said last week. CRE was a contributing factor in the deaths, but the exact cause of the deaths wasn't immediately disclosed in those cases either. Hospital officials there have said the outbreak was caused by two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even though disinfection guidelines were followed. The UCLA hospital was using a duodenoscope made by Olympus, but the Food and Drug Administration is also reviewing data from the two other U.S. companies that make the devices, Fujifilm and Pentax. The medical center is contacting 179 others who underwent endoscopic procedures between October and January. It's offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. In a statement, McCarthy said Carolinas HealthCare System uses standard methods for disinfecting its equipment, saying that all duodenoscopes that have been tested have shown to be negative for CRE. Some CRE bacteria can resist most antibiotics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. CNN's Ben Tinker, Michael Martinez and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.</td>\n",
