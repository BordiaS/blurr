       "      <td>(Rolling Stone) -- Rock stars and merchandising extraordinaires KISS have joined forces with Fox's animated hit \"Family Guy\" for a co-branded product line that will hit stores in fall, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Fox will develop the products with KISS' licensing agent, Live Nation Merchandise, and will look for partners to make everything from bobblehead dolls to apparel to fine art. For a band that has licensed their image to everything from lunch boxes to pinball machines, KISS' new partnership makes total sense. According to singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, the deal comes as KISS \"are focusing more and more on the upper-tier, blue-chip opportunities for prestige partnerships. \"Family Guy's\" track record and consistent success with its demographic makes this match-up ideal.\" KISS are no strangers to \"Family Guy,\" having already made three cameos on the program. They have even become part of a running storyline that involves a previous relationship between Lois Griffin and KISS bassist/ladies' man Gene Simmons. \"KISS and 'Family Guy' coming together for a line of products is a great mash-up of two iconic brands that speaks directly to fans who will be able to enjoy something a little different and special with what we have in store,\" said Jeffrey Godsick, president of Fox Consumer Products. The joint licensing venture is the first in the company's new series, which will encompass other notable \"Family Guy\" guests in the future. KISS are in for a busy summer, cartoon merch aside; they will hit the road alongside fellow metal deities MÃ¶tley Crue for a 40-date North American trek, simply dubbed \"The Tour.\" Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- The 30-mile stretch between Biloxi and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, is still dotted with battle wounds from Hurricane Katrina seven years later. Concrete slabs and steps that lead to nothing but trash and overgrown weeds are all that is left of historic brick homes. But amid the slabs are majestic homes with grand, sweeping porches and perfectly manicured lawns. The owners of these homes are as tough and resilient as only survivors of one of the deadliest storms in history could be. State-by-state: Isaac evacuations, delays. Lifelong Bay St. Louis resident Corky Hadden lives on the spot of his childhood home, set off the water where the bay feeds into the Gulf of Mexico. While he and his family evacuated to safety inland, Katrina's ravaging storm surge swept the house right off its stilts, leaving only the foundation intact. \"We had some old columns that the old house stood on, and those columns were picked clean, there was nothing left on them,\" he said. Determined, Hadden rebuilt where his boyhood home once stood, both stronger and higher. \"I've got poured concrete pillars filled with steel, 10 times more steel than before,\" he said. \"We're now 24 feet above sea level, 11 feet from the ground.\" Isaac could bring in a 12-foot storm surge, which would mean Hadden's first floor could take on some water. \"We don't have anything important below that 24-foot elevation,\" he said. Live blog: Isaac moves in. Air conditioning units and electric boxes are strategically placed on the house's second floor, safely away from most critical dangers. Outside, the air is full of Isaac's portents. The normally calming sounds of the surf are dimmed by hurricane flags clanging loudly against an old converted ship mast in Hadden's front yard. The blazing red flags with the signature black squares in the center stand out in stark contrast to the temporarily blue sky. Hadden and his neighbors are wary but calm. \"I think everybody has come back in a much stronger fashion,\" he said. \"We're watching, but we're prepared.\" Riding eastward toward Gulfport along white sand beaches with sparkling blue waters, beautiful antebellum-style homes grace the coastline. The stately green manse where Ben and Nancy Stone live right off the beach is a new construction, a near replica of the 1800s-era house that was obliterated by Katrina. iReport: Share your images</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- It's been six years -- 2007, if you're into counting numbers -- since the once sleepy fishing port of Macau surpassed Las Vegas as the world leader in gambling revenue. We love the flash. And the occasional winning night at the tables. But there's a slower side to this city of just less than 600,000 residents, one of cobblestone lanes, colonial mansions, art deco buildings and tranquil parks, all done in a fusion of Chinese and Portuguese motifs. The best part is that Macau (just an hour from Hong Kong by ferry) is compact, making it a breeze to explore. Here's a primer. 1. Baccarat is the game of choice. Macau is the gambling capital of the world. By far the most popular game is baccarat, a relatively simple game with a low house advantage (less than 1%). Baccarat tables dominate the city's 33 casinos. There are plenty of slot machines as well, but they offer a high house advantage and aren't popular. This is the reverse of Las Vegas where gamblers favor slots. Macau's revenue from gambling is $33 billion, more than five times that of the Las Vegas Strip. Tycoon Stanley Ho's 40-year reign as the city's casino kingpin came to an end in 2002 when the Macau government ended the monopoly system. Today, there are six casino operators: SJM Holdings (Stanley Ho), Wynn Macau, Sands China, Galaxy Entertainment Group, MGM China Holdings and Melco Crown Entertainment. 2. Macau was the first and last European colony in China. The Portuguese settled in Macau in the 16th century and the island was handed back to China in 1999. Today, Macau is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) -- as is Hong Kong -- and is governed under the \"one country, two systems\" principal, which was the brainchild of late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Although no longer a colony, Portuguese is still an official language and the Portuguese influence can be seen everywhere from blue tiled street signs to tiled floors and beautiful gardens.

Macau has the world's highest population density with 20,497 people per square kilometer. No surprise then that it needed to do something dramatic to make room for new casinos and 30 million visitors that come every year. The solution was a massive</td>\n",

       "      <td>(AOL Autos) -- The conventional wisdom, among most folks, anyway, is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity, by those on a budget -- that is, people who want, or need, to \"move down\" from the new-car market because a new model is simply out of their reach. Bottom line, the Lexus reputation is for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability. However, there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income: used luxury cars. For some buyers, the used-luxury market is a way of getting into that Lexus, Lincoln, Infiniti or Porsche you always wanted, without laying out $70,000 or $80,000 for something you're not actually going to live in. For others, scouring the used-luxury-car listings is a way of re-visiting the halcyon years of their youth. At this point, some of these used-luxe models have been around so long that they almost qualify as vintage throwback editions. Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range. Using CR's recommendations as a guideline, here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $24,000-30,000 price range. 2005 &amp; 2006 Acura MDX. A luxury SUV, the MDX is spacious, seats seven, and boasts distinctive styling and Acura's famed attention to detail. Plus, it packs some punch under the hood -- this generation was powered by 3.5-liter, 253-hp V6 matched to a five-speed automatic transmission. AOL Autos: Used Acura. Priced just right as a new vehicle, it included safety features like dual-stage front airbags, three-point seatbelts and adjustable head restraints for all seating positions. 2007 Acura RDX. A crossover vehicle that mixes sedan-like ride with SUV roominess, the '07 RDX offered unibody construction, leather upholstery, heated front seats, power moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, xenon HID headlights with foglamps and the 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- plus a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel, and the patented SH-AWD (SH for Super Handling)</td>\n",

A judge also ordered Cassidy, 63, to spend 90 days in alcohol rehab, but since he's been in a residential program since his arrest in January he will be able to check out soon and resume his entertainment career, his manager said,. In fact, the former \"Partridge Family\" singer has gigs booked starting in North Carolina next month. Cassidy was arrested after a California Highway Patrol officer stopped him for making an illegal turn at a red light near the Los Angeles International Airport in January. The singer-actor blew.19 -- twice the legal level -- on an alcohol test administered by the officer who stopped his rented Chevrolet Impala, according to a California Highway Patrol statement. It was his second DUI arrest in six months and third since 2011. 'Partridge Family' dispute led to Cassidy drinking relapse. His manager told CNN several days after his latest arrest that Cassidy's drinking was the result of stressful questioning he had just undergone by lawyers about a legal dispute regarding \"Partridge Family\" profits. \"David just completed a stint in rehab and was doing very well in sobriety,\" manager Jo-Ann Geffen said. \"He was in Los Angeles to attend depositions by Sony Pictures Television, respondents in a lawsuit filed by Cassidy in 2011 over what he claims are monies long due him from 'Partridge Family' merchandise, home video, etc.,\" she said. \"After attending his and his manager's depositions, it appears as if the pressure led to a brief relapse.\" On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was then Cassidy's real-life stepmother). The family, all musicians, traveled to gigs in a brightly repainted school bus. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teenage girls attracted to such hits as \"I Think I Love You.\" Photos: Celebrity substance abuse confessions.</td>\n",

South African President Jacob Zuma on Sunday announced the deployment of 400 troops \"to render support in fulfillment of an international obligation of the Republic of South Africa towards the CAR.\" Read more: Diplomats seek progress on Central African Republic crisis. Despite fits and starts in the peace process, the insurgency in the Central African Republic remains an active and real threat to the government of President Francois Bozize. On Saturday, rebels attacked two more towns -- having already seized several others, as well as threatening to head to the capital of Bangui -- according to a government official. Zuma's directive does not indicate South African troops will fight rebels directly. Rather, the statement says they \"will assist with capacity building of the CAR Defense Force and will also assist CAR with the planning and implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes.\" Read more: Central African Republic president seeks help against rebels. \"The employment of members of (South Africa's military) to CAR is one of the efforts that South Africa is making to bring about peace and stability in the region,\" said the South African statement, which was released through government spokesman Mac Maharaj. The crisis started in December, when the Seleka rebel coalition accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal and demanded he step down. They seized towns in the northern part of the landlocked country and threatened to march on Bangui. Bozize has called on the international community, including the United States and France, to help stave off the rebellion.
