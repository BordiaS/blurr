King says he's part of group of investors interested in acquiring the franchise, despite its apparent financial troubles and unresolved contract issues with Fox Sports. Major League Baseball, which took charge of the team in April, has been embroiled in legal battles over future media rights after baseball Commissioner Bud Selig rejected a $3 billion television deal with Fox. The beleaguered club then filed for bankruptcy in June and has since drawn a number of high-profile buyers into the bidding process after team owner Frank McCourt agreed to sell. A court hearing over the Dodgers' future media rights is scheduled for December 7. King's investor group, meanwhile, is led by insurance agent Dennis Gilbert, who also works as a special assistant to Chicago White Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. \"What bigger thrill?\" asked King, a native of Brooklyn, New York, which the Dodgers once called home. The team, formerly known as the Trolley Dodgers because of the maze of trolley cars that Brooklynites once dodged in the streets, eventually shortened its name, then and moved to California, kicking off its first L.A. season in 1958, to the dismay of many New Yorkers. \"The emotional part would be that they'd have to carry me out,\" King said of his possible part-ownership stake in the team.</td>\n",

Though they have said they believe two men were involved in the kidnapping, by Saturday police had only identified one by name as a \"wanted suspect\": 30-year-old Tobias Dustin Summers. In a press conference a few hours before Summers' image and information came out, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Andrew Smith said that police believe this was a \"stranger abduction.\" At the same time, he said, investigators are not ruling anything out -- such as whether the abductors had something to do with her family or that acquaintances of hers might have been involved. \"Until we can find these individuals that perpetrated this, we won't know if this was a random case, or whether it was targeted against this family or this child for any particular reason,\" Smith said. \"So, right now, we don't know.\" Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, the girl's mother last saw her safe in bed in their home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Northridge. The mother heard noises at about 3:30 a.m. and checked on her daughter again, discovering that she was missing. That set off an intensive search for the girl that ended about 2:50 p.m. Wednesday, when she was found about five miles southwest of her home. \"A Good Samaritan... directed the girl to some police officers nearby, and she was... transported to a local hospital, where she received treatment,\" Cmdr. Andrew Smith, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, told reporters Saturday afternoon. By Saturday, the 10-year-old was back home with her parents, with police on site to provide security and protect the family's privacy. Some 20 members of the police department's robbery and homicide division are working the case, Smith said. In a first preliminary interview with investigators, the girl said she had been put in several vehicles during her 12-hour ordeal, driving to places around the San Fernando Valley. Police were able to locate at least one of those locations -- a storage facility about two miles from the girl's home -- Smith said. The LAPD spokesman did not detail what happened to the girl in that time, urging media to do the same so as not to \"further traumatize... that poor girl.\" Smith said that authorities don't have any reason</td>\n",

But there's a fun flip-side to the murkiness: Speculating on what those ratings and their explanations might infer about the movie in question â€” in this case, \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" The MPAA handed a PG-13 rating today to \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" for \"intense sequences of violence and action, some sensuality and language.\" The rating itself does not mean the movie is totally done -- films often screen well before the director is finished with technical elements like visual effects, sound design, and color timing. But it does provide us with a tantalizing indication for what may be in store with a wildly anticipated film that has otherwise put a high premium on plot details. Namely: Language? Sensuality?

Among the growing chorus of critics was Turkey's President Abdullah Gul. \"I take particular care not to make any direct statements on issues that are in the judicial process,\" Gul wrote in a series of statements on his Twitter account on Friday. \"[But] the decision about reducing the punishment related with what happened to a young child of ours made me deeply uncomfortable... there is still the possibility for an appeal.

The group, Article 25, worked with local craftspeople to develop a design that could withstand earthquakes and trained them to build the structures. That experience may provide some lessons for the rebuilding of Haiti, where Article 25 is also planning to help with reconstruction, according to Robin Cross, an architect who is the organization's director of projects. As in Haiti, at least some of the death and injury in Pakistan stemmed from local building methods. \"The important point is that it isn't generally earthquakes that kill people,\" Cross said. \"It's generally buildings that kill people. Building design is a way to solve that problem.\" In Pakistan, Article 25 worked with local craftspeople to determine the best way to build structures that could withstand quakes and then helped train people to build them. \"By the time we built 80 to 100 buildings and we pulled out, we were leaving not just buildings, but also a capacity to</td>\n",

Lohan, who faces a preliminary hearing on a felony grand theft charge April 22, could also go back to jail on a probation violation charge on the same day. But the Riverside County, California, district attorney decided Tuesday not to pursue a possible assault charge against the actress for a December 12, 2010, incident with Dawn Holland, a Betty Ford Center staffer, the prosecutor's spokesman said. \"Our office has completed review of the case, and we will not file charges due to insufficient evidence,\" spokesman John Hall said. Lohan checked herself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California, for substance abuse rehab on September 28, 2010, just days after she dodged jail on another probation violation. A Los Angeles County judge later ordered her to remain in the drug rehab program until January 3 for failing a drug test while on supervised probation for a 2007 drunken-driving charge. An incident three weeks after she was released from rehab led to her latest legal problems.

       "      <td>A California poultry producer announced Monday that it is working with the federal health officials after an estimated 278 illnesses were reported in 18 states. Raw chicken products from Foster Farms plants have been identified as the likely source of this outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg. Illnesses were linked to the facility through investigations conducted by local, state, and federal officials. The outbreak is continuing and no recall has been issued. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has been unable so far to identify the specific product or production period, but raw products from the potentially affected facilities bear one of the following numbers on the packaging: P6137, P6137A, P7632 and mainly distributed to retail outlets in California, Oregon and Washington state. Food poisoning: What you need to know. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is partnering with state health departments to monitor the outbreak while FSIS continues its investigation, but due to the government shutdown, current information may not be available on the agencies' websites. \"While the company, FSIS and CDC continue to investigate the issue, Foster Farms has instituted a number of additional food safety practices, processes and technology</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN) -- The massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on Friday spared the island of Indonesia, a nearby developing country that was devastated in 2004 by one of the deadliest tsunamis in history. Helping after that disaster was CNN Hero Robin Lim. Lim is the founder of Indonesia's Yayasan Bumi Sehat health clinics, which provide free prenatal and birthing care to women in need. Lim recently spoke with CNN's Ebonne Ruffins about how her midwife teams respond in natural disasters, balancing critical medical needs with cultural traditions. Ebonne Ruffins: What's it like to work in Indonesia and, specifically, after the 2004 tsunami? Robin Lim: In Indonesia, there is a great need for us because many mothers want the help of professional birth attendants but can't afford them. So they come to us. It was not easy to start so grass-roots in Bali, completely reliant on donations, but we did it. And when the tsunami happened a few years later in Aceh, we were early responders. So many on the eastern coast lost everything, and it was very difficult to witness. But we had to be there</td>\n",
