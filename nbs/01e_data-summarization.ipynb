She was 76. Best known as an artist for 1973's sultry \"Pillow Talk,\" Robinson was a \"trendsetter\" in music, publicist Lynn K. Hobson told CNN. \"She was known as the founder of hip-hop,\" Hobson said. \"She was vibrant, with an over-the-top personality.\" Robinson's singing, producing and songwriting career dated back to the 1950s, when she recorded as \"Little Sylvia\" and later as one half of the duo \"Mickey &amp; Sylvia.\" The team's hit \"Love Is Strange,\" which hit the pop charts in early 1957 and reached No. 1 on the rhythm-and-blues chart, found new life three decades later in the 1987 movie \"Dirty Dancing.\" She also produced \"Love On a Two-Way Street\" for the Moments in 1970. Born Sylvia Vanterpool, Robinson and her late husband, Joe, founded Sugar Hill Records in 1979 and released the early hip hop hit, \"Rapper's Delight,\" performed by the Sugar Hill Gang. Her eldest son, Joey, was a member of the group she formed. The song, which adapted the musical track of Chic's \"Good Times,\" began with the familiar lines, \"I said a hip hop, a hippie, a hippie to the hip hip hop, you don't stop to rock it.\" The label also signed Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, which had success in the 1980s, including the hit \"The Message.\" Kanye West and Alicia Keys are among the artists who sampled songs associated with Robinson, Hobson said. The funeral is scheduled for October 11 at Community Baptist Church in Englewood, New Jersey. \"RIP to my grandmother,\" MTV personality Darnell Robinson, the entrepreneur's grandson, wrote on his Twitter account Thursday. \"We lost Mommy Sylvia this morning but she will never be forgotten!\" CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.</td>\n",

Speaking to the official Masters website, the Northern Irishman said: \"I'm very disappointed. \"I was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go, and I just unraveled. Hit a bad tee shot on 10, and then never really recovered. It's going to be hard to take for a few days, but I'll get over it.\" McIlroy is not alone in crumbling on the back nine whilst leading the Masters and joins a famous list that includes great names such as Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Scott Hoch and Greg Norman. Can McIlroy conquer mental minefield? And McIlory admitted that when he missed the fairway on the 13th hole, he knew his Masters dream had died. \"I'd knew that unless I birdied my way in, I realized I didn't have a chance,\" McIlroy said. \"I realized that was it then. \"But this is my first experience at it and hopefully the next time I'm in this position I'll be able to handle it better. \"I didn't handle it particularly well obviously, but it was a character-building day, put it that way. I'll come out stronger for it.\" And, speaking on his Twitter feed, McIlroy quoted Muhammad Ali, saying: \"It's repetition of affirmations that leads to belief -- and once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen.\" McIlory also received some words of encouragement from Schwartzel who said: \"Golf is a really funny game -- one moment you're on top of it, the next moment it bites you. \"Rory is going to feel hurt. It's not easy what he went through. He is such a phenomenal player and he will win one. \"The first just happens to be the toughest, and that may be the biggest lesson of all,\" added the South African.</td>\n",
