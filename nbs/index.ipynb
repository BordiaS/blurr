    "> An extensible integration of huggingface transformer models with fastai v2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named after the **fast**est **transformer** (well, at least of the Autobots), **blurr** provides both a comprehensive and extensible framework for training and deploying *all* [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) transformer models with [fastai v2](http://dev.fast.ai/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing features like fastai's new `@typedispatch` decorator and a simple class hiearchy, **blurr** provides fastai developers with the ability to train and deploy transformers for sequence classification, question answer, token classification, summarization, and language modeling tasks. Though much of this works out-of-the-box, users will be able to customize the tokenization strategies and model inputs based on task and/or architecture as needed.\n",

( don't even * think * i'm going to attempt spelling his last name! ), an american p. o. w. caught in an underground bunker. you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes ( but, let's face it, most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon, surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders ). the graphics are, as i mentioned before, quite dated and very simple. the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators. if you can get over that, however ( and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you ), then you've got one heck of a good shooter / sneaking game. the game play consists of searching for keys, health and ammo, blasting enemies ( aforementioned nazis, and a \" boss enemy \" per chapter ) of varying difficulty ( which, of course, grows as you move further in the game ), unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms. there is a bonus count after each level is beaten... it goes by how fast you were ( basically, if you beat the'par time ', which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level ; this can be quite fun to try and beat, and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in, they are even challenging after many play - throughs ), how much nazi gold ( treasure ) you collected and how many bad guys you killed. basically, if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned, you get a bonus, helping you reach the coveted high score placings. the game ( mostly, but not always ) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see. you can either run or walk, and amongst your weapons is also a knife... running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard, as [SEP]</td>\n",
