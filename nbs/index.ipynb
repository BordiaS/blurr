    "> An extensible integration of huggingface transformer models with fastai v2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named after the **fast**est **transformer** (well, at least of the Autobots), **blurr** provides both a comprehensive and extensible framework for training and deploying *all* [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) transformer models with [fastai v2](http://dev.fast.ai/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing features like fastai's new `@typedispatch` and `@patch` decorators, and a simple class hiearchy, **blurr** provides fastai developers with the ability to train and deploy transformers for sequence classification, question answer, token classification, summarization, and language modeling tasks. Though much of this works out-of-the-box, users will be able to customize the tokenization strategies and model inputs based on task and/or architecture as needed.\n",

    "* Extended fastai's `Learner` object with a `predict_tokens` method used specifically in token classification\n",
    "* `HF_BaseModelCallback` can be used (or extended) instead of the model wrapper to ensure your inputs into the huggingface model is correct (recommended). See docs for examples (and thanks to fastai's Sylvain for the suggestion!)\n",
    "* `HF_Tokenizer` can work with strings or a string representation of a list (the later helpful for token classification tasks)\n",
    "* `show_batch` and `show_results` methods have been updated to allow better control on how huggingface tokenized data is represented in those methods"
