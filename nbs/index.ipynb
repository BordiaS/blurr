    "\n",
    "Named after the **fast**est **transformer** (well, at least of the Autobots), ***blurr*** provides both a comprehensive and extensible framework for training and deploying *all* 🤗 [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) transformer models with [fastai](http://dev.fast.ai) v2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing features like fastai's new `@typedispatch` and `@patch` decorators, and a simple class hiearchy, **blurr** provides fastai developers with the ability to train and deploy transformers for sequence classification, question answer, token classification, summarization, and language modeling tasks. Though much of this works out-of-the-box, users will be able to customize the tokenization strategies and model inputs based on task and/or architecture as needed.\n",
