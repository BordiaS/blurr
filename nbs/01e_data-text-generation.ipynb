       "      <td>Israel is confronting a problem beyond the Hamas rockets screeching overhead -- a threat underfoot. The Israeli military says it is trying to demolish a sophisticated network of tunnels that run through parts of northeast Gaza, under the border and into southern Israel. Hamas has already used the tunnels several times in the past few days to attempt assaults on Israeli soil. The first attack, on July 17, was foiled but prompted Israel to announce a ground incursion into Gaza with the stated aim of taking out the tunnels. Another assault through tunnels s few days later resulted in clashes that killed more than 10 Hamas fighters and four Israeli soldiers. The assault near the town of Sderot appeared to target two communal areas \"where farmers are trying to conduct their daily lives,\" said Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev. The Hamas fighters were disguised as Israeli soldiers, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The clashes forced area roads to close, residents to shelter in their homes and tied up security forces for hours. The method of attack, in which militants spring out unexpectedly from underground, has struck fear into Israelis living near Gaza. \"Your enemy is about to blast his way into your dining room from below the floor while you are feeding your family. Sounds like a B-rated horror movie, right? This scenario is one real example of a Hamas tunnel discovered just in time by the IDF leading into a kibbutz communal dining hall,\" Benay Browne Katz, a volunteer medic and grandmother who lives in Jaffa, told CNN. 'Lower Gaza' The tunnel network has also been used during combat inside Gaza, the Israeli military says, allowing Hamas fighters to pop up and fire on soldiers or toss grenades before dropping back out of sight. Israeli military officials refer to the underground works as \"Lower Gaza\" and suggest at least some of the war is being waged underground. The tunnels aren't a new phenomenon. Hamas used one in 2006 to capture the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and take him back into Gaza. He was held captive for five years until a deal was struck for his release in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Memories of his capture were revived by a foiled attack over the weekend, in which one Hamas fighter who entered Israel through a tunnel was found to be carrying tranquilizers and handcuffs, according to the Israeli military. 'A whole industry' Israel received a warning of the growing scale and sophistication of the underground threat last year with the discovery of a tunnel that ran from the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza and emerged near the Israeli</td>\n",

       "      <td>(CNN)The same superbug that contributed to two deaths in Los Angeles has been reported in North Carolina, where one person has died, a spokesman told CNN. Eighteen people have contracted carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, so far this year, said Kevin McCarthy, spokesman with the Carolinas HealthCare System. Of those, 15 had CRE upon admission to the hospital in Charlotte; three acquired it in the hospital, and one died, the spokesman said. The cause of death was not immediately clear. McCarthy declined to provide details on any of the patients. It was also not clear how any of them became infected. In Los Angeles, seven patients contracted CRE after routine endoscopic procedures. Two of them died, the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center said last week. CRE was a contributing factor in the deaths, but the exact cause of the deaths wasn't immediately disclosed in those cases either. Hospital officials there have said the outbreak was caused by two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even though disinfection guidelines were followed. The UCLA hospital was using a duodenoscope made by Olympus, but the Food and Drug Administration is also reviewing data from the two other U.S. companies that make the devices, Fujifilm and Pentax. The medical center is contacting 179 others who underwent endoscopic procedures between October and January. It's offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. In a statement, McCarthy said Carolinas HealthCare System uses standard methods for disinfecting its equipment, saying that all duodenoscopes that have been tested have shown to be negative for CRE. Some CRE bacteria can resist most antibiotics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. CNN's Ben Tinker, Michael Martinez and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.</td>\n",
