      <td>[CLS] raising victor vargas : a review &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; you know, raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big, steaming bowl of oatmeal. it's warm and gooey, but you're not sure if it feels right. try as i might, no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn't quite feel right. victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director's part. apparently, the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side, and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof. he was right, but it didn't fool me. raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen - year old boy called, you guessed it, victor vargas ( victor rasuk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they've toured. the movie starts off in ` ugly fat'donna's bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her, but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best - friend harold ( kevin rivera ) comes - a - looking for him. caught in the attempt by harold and his sister, victor vargas runs off for damage control. yet even with the embarrassing implication that he's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood, nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat. on a hot, new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy ( judy marte ), who's not just pretty, but a strong and independent too. the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film. the story also focuses on victor's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita ( altagracia guzman ), his brother nino ( also played by real life brother to victor, silvestre rasuk ) and his sister vicky ( krystal rodriguez ). the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family. victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp - daddy, his feelings for judy and his grandmother's conservative catholic upbringing. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few, but glaring errors. throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky, nino, grandma, judy and even [SEP]</td>

      <td>[CLS] now that che ( 2008 ) has finished its relatively short australian cinema run ( extremely limited release : 1 screen in sydney, after 6wks ), i can guiltlessly join both hosts of " at the movies " in taking steven soderbergh to task. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; it's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style / subject, but soderbergh's most recent stinker, the girlfriend experience ( 2009 ), was also missing a story, so narrative ( and editing? ) seem to suddenly be soderbergh's main challenge. strange, after 20 - odd years in the business. he was probably never much good at narrative, just hid it well inside " edgy " projects. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; none of this excuses him this present, almost diabolical failure. as david stratton warns, " two parts of che don't ( even ) make a whole ". &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; epic biopic in name only, che ( 2008 ) barely qualifies as a feature film! it certainly has no legs, inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history, soderbergh's 4. 5hrs - long dirge just goes nowhere. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; even margaret pomeranz, the more forgiving of australia's at the movies duo, noted about soderbergh's repetitious waste of ( hd digital storage ) : " you're in the woods... you're in the woods... you're in the woods... ". i too am surprised soderbergh didn't give us another 2. 5hrs of that somewhere between his existing two parts, because he still left out massive chunks of che's " revolutionary " life! &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; for a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure, soderbergh unaccountably alienates, if not deliberately insults, his audiences by &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 1. never providing most of che's story ; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 2. imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition ; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 3. ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events ; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; 4. barely developing an idea, or a character ; [SEP]</td>

( and not even then ) but, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining. i didn't like that, either. what the movie's press release should have said is... " we got the basic, very basic, idea from shirley jackson's book, we kept the same names of the house and several ( though not all ) of the leading character's names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too.
