summary: "This module contains the bits required to use the fastai DataBlock API and/or mid-level data processing pipelines to organize your data for text generation tasks using architectures like BART, T5, or good ol' GPT2, etc....  Abstract summarization and conversational agents are good examples of such tasks."

      <td>London (CNN) -- More than three meters above east London's Sclater Street is a mural of sprinter Usain Bolt, captured in explosive color by artist James Cochran. The street artwork, more than four meters high and six meters wide, is a dramatic sight, designed by Cochran to celebrate London's Olympic Games. Cochran, known as "Jimmy C," has a style which combines his background in graffiti art and academic training in figurative realism. The UK-born artist is based in London's Shoreditch, having spent much of his life in Australia. After his mother died in a car crash when Cochran was 12, his family life deteriorated. At 16, he spent three months on the streets where he began painting with aerosol cans. Cochran later completed a visual arts degree at the University of South Australia, before going on to complete a masters degree. The Olympics miss: Why street art should be embraced not snubbed. His art often depicts the homeless, as he seeks to capture "a more raw essence of the human subject." Cochran's style has evolved from what he calls "aerosol pointillism," with its impressionist overtones, to "atomic pointillism, in which the subject appears to atomize. Why gritty East End is London's gold standard. Cochran also explores the relationship between individuals and the urban landscape, which has led to paintings of buildings sprouting from heads -- one of which can be seen in this Sam Taylor-Wood directed REM video. Cochran's canvases sell for thousands of pounds. But he continues to paint on the streets, and his work can be found in cities including Paris, Berlin and New York. "When you paint on the street there is a lot more rawness to it," Cochran says. "Anything can happen." East London, where the city's Olympic Games are based, is a hub for street art. "That's the great thing about Shoreditch and Hackney," says Cochran. "[The art] is part of the look of the street."</td>

      <td>(CNN) -- Sarin gas has been used several times in the Syrian civil war, including at least once by the Assad regime, France's foreign minister said Tuesday, citing results from test samples in France's possession. Laurent Fabius announced that conclusion after meeting with the head of a United Nations mission set up to establish the facts about the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. "I gave him the results of tests carried out by our lab appointed by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to identify chemical warfare," Fabius said in a statement, referring to the Swedish scientist Professor Ake Sellstrom. "These results show the presence of sarin in the samples that are in our possession," Fabius said. "In view of these elements, France now has the certainty that the sarin gas was used in Syria several times and in a localized manner." In an interview later Tuesday with CNN affiliate France 2, Fabius blamed the Syrian government in at least one of the cases. "There is no doubt that it is the regime and its accomplices," Fabius said. He added the French government examined the chain of events from the moment of the attack through the lab results to determine that government was responsible. Fabius' announcement did not say when or where the weapons may have been used or who may have used the gas in the other cases. Syrian rebels have been fighting the government for more than two years. Atrocities have been blamed on both sides. The announcement coincided with the release of a draft report posted on the website of the U.N. Human Rights Council that concludes: "There are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical agents have been used as weapons. The precise agents, delivery systems or perpetrators could not be identified." In Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney said the United States was working with the French and other allies as well as the Syrian opposition to determine those answers. "We need to expand the evidence we have," he told reporters Tuesday. "We need to make it reviewable; we need to have it corroborated before we make any decisions based on the clear violation that use of chemical weapons would represent by the Syrian regime. So, we will continue in that effort." Asked how long that might take, he said, "I don't have a timetable for you." He noted that Damascus has consistently turned down U.S. requests for a U.N. investigative team to be sent to Syria. "But we are not relying on the United Nations alone," he said. "We are aggressively pursuing</td>
