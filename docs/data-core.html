<p><a href="/blurr/data-core#HF_TokenizerTransform"><code>HF_TokenizerTransform</code></a> was inspired by <a href="http://dev.fast.ai/tutorial.transformers">this article</a>.  It handles both the tokenization and numericalization traditionally split apart in the fastai text DataBlock API.  For huggingface tokenizers that require a prefix space, it will be included automatically.</p>
<p>You can pass a string or list into this Transform, the later being for tasks that require two input sequneces (e.g. question answer tasks for example require a "context" and a "question" sequence).</p>
<p>In order to make the tokenization/numericalization process more efficient, this transform has been updated to return a <code>transformers.tokenization_utils_base.BatchEncoding</code> dictionary with all the required transformer inputs (e.g. input_ids, attention_mask, etc...). Previously, it only returned the raw input_ids for <em>each</em> sequence which were then put together to come up with all the required inputs and padding in a <code>before_batch</code> transform.</p>

      <td>"National Treasure" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy cliché that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another  attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble  if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?your guess is as good as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah  brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, "is that the Hope Diamond?"</td>
