      <td>London, England (CNN) -- Olympic triple-jump champion Christian Taylor knows all about putting his best foot forward. But in order to continue competing in the sport he loves, he's had to go back to square one. Retrain his muscle memory and try a new way. For an athlete who's used to constantly repeating his routine, day after day, year after year, it was a big deal. "All my life I've jumped from my left foot -- that was my takeoff -- and even winning the 2012 Olympics, that was the foot I jumped from, so the idea of switching feet was pretty crazy," the American tells CNN's Human to Hero series. "You have to almost use a different side of the brain. My left leg was muscle memory, I could do that day in, day out, and now to do that off my right, it took a little while to get over it." So why take such a big risk? Taylor had no choice -- triple-jumping had taken its toll on his knee joints and he was facing the prospect of having to quit in his prime; at 22, he was the youngest man to win the discipline's Olympic title in 100 years. "People around me would say, 'You've won so many things, can you not continue through the pain?' but it was to the point that it was either that I try and blow out my knee or I just give it up," says the 2011 world champion. "I love this too much -- my passion for it exceeded the doubt -- and once I just committed to it, I was like this is it. I'm going to make it happen. "My parents always brought me up with the saying, 'Where there's a will there's a way,' so I was willing to do what it took and now I'm making the way." During the hard times that followed, he was able to draw on the religious beliefs instilled in him by his grandmother. "My faith keeps me to who I am, because a lot of times there are a lot of distractions, a lot of pressures that come with the lifestyle," Taylor explains. "But keeping that faith and just remembering who I am is very important to me. I have my daily devotions." His persistence has paid off. While he finished outside the medals at last year's world championships, finishing fourth, he has completed a hat-trick of titles in the lucrative Diamond League series. A season's best leap of 17.51 meters at the Zurich meeting in August</td>

      <td>Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- Army Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs has been sentenced to life in military prison with eligibility for parole in 10 years. A military court-martial Thursday found Gibbs guilty of murdering three Afghan civilians, illegally cutting off pieces of their corpses to keep as "souvenirs" and planting weapons to make the men appear as if they were Taliban fighters killed in legitimate firefights. He was reduced in rank to private and ordered to forfeit all pay and benefits. Whatever sentence Gibbs serves will be reduced by the 547 days he has already spent in prison. "He said they were all dirty savages," prosecutor Maj. Andre Leblanc said at Gibbs' sentencing hearing. "He is the savage, not the innocent Afghans he murdered. It is monstrous. What kind of savagery does it take to do this? To cut a finger off a victim and show it to people? This is a savage being" Gibbs' attorney, Phillip Stackhouse, had asked the court for a sentence of life with parole so Gibbs would have the opportunity to be with his now-3-year-old son again. "He has a long time to reflect on his life, what he has done and what he wants to do in the future," Stackhouse said. Gibbs is the highest ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue "kill squad" that targeted civilians. Another seven soldiers also were charged with lesser crimes including abusing drugs, keeping "off the books" weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier not to speak out against the platoon's alleged killings. Gibbs had pleaded not guilty. A prosecutor described Gibbs as a "recruiting poster" soldier. But the tall, clean-cut Gibbs and the "kill squad" he was convicted of leading turned into a public-relations nightmare for the military. "Sgt. Gibbs had a charisma, he had a 'follow me' personality," Maj. Robert Stelle, a prosecutor in the case, told the court in closing arguments Wednesday. "But it was all a bunch of crap, he had his own mission: murder and depravity." The murders Gibbs is accused of committing took place over a period of five months last year, while Gibbs led the 3rd Platoon of the ArmyÂ¹s 5th Stryker Brigade in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. Gibbs' platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with an Afghan population wary of the U.S. presence in their country. Instead</td>
