      <td>It's no secret that a battle has boiled over in the Republican Party. The fight has played out in the policy arena but also on the campaign trail. And since the inception of the tea party in 2009, it seemed like that wing had the upper hand. It slowly made effective inroads into a party many members of the vocal new group thought had lost its way. They elected a new breed of Republican into office, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who surprised the political world by defeating establishment-backed candidates in their respective primaries. But those two successes haven't been the norm, especially in the Senate, as many inexperienced but ideologically more pure candidates have been unable to seal the deal. In 2010, Sharron Angle won the Senate primary in Nevada and Christine O'Donnell won in Delaware. Two years later, Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin won in Indiana and Missouri respectively. All four went on to lose against the Democrat. In a year in which Republicans have their best shot in several elections of regaining control of the Senate, party leaders are hoping to avoid general election stumbles. The Republican establishment is off to a good start this primary season, but it had an easy opener. Texas Sen. John Cornyn easily won his primary against tea party backed challenger Rep. Steve Stockman, who was largely persona-non-grata during his campaign. Still he spent $2.6 million in the final weeks leading up to the early March primary. Brian Walsh, a former Cornyn spokesman and former communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which works to get Republicans elected to the Senate, said Cornyn did the work necessary to beat a challenger, including researching possible opponents and raising money. "It's not a coincidence that John Cornyn won," he said. Republican incumbents fight back. Senate Republicans want to make sure that what happened in Texas happens elsewhere. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who is facing a primary challenge from Matt Bevin, has taken the unusual step of publicly criticizing at least one group working to defeat some GOP incumbents, including McConnell - the Senate Conservative Fund. "I think we are going to crush them everywhere," referring to SCF-backed candidates. "I don't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country," he said in a recent interview with The New York Times. And in an interview with The Weekly Standard, McConnell said the organization is giving conservatism "a bad name." "We know their business model is only</td>

      <td>When Rachel Frederickson, 24, stepped out onto the stage at NBC's "The Biggest Loser" finale Tuesday night, some wondered if she had gone too far. While the show is known for its dramatic weight loss transformations -- most winners lose more than 50% of their body weight -- Frederickson appeared extremely thin. And the looks on trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels' faces could be interpreted as shock -- or dismay. Frederickson went from 260 pounds to 105 pounds, losing 59.62% of her body weight. At 5 feet, 5 inches tall, that puts her body mass index at 17.5. Anything under 18.5 is considered by the National Institutes of Health to be underweight. NBC on Wednesday declined to comment on its $250,000 grand prize winner, a voice-over artist who lives in Los Angeles. Social media, however, was buzzing. "Are you kidding?" One woman wrote on the show's Facebook page. "Rachel looks anorexic! She has gone from one extreme to the other!" Other posts called Frederickson "frail" and said she seemed "dizzy" and "disoriented" on stage. "She obviously worked incredibly hard to achieve her weight loss goals, but I am wondering if the pressure of winning a large cash prize caused her to take it too far," one said. Others posted on Frederickson's Facebook page, asking her to get help and expressing disappointment. "I'm saddened that my 13-year-old daughter watched as you were rewarded for doing that to your body," one woman said. Frederickson as of Wednesday had not responded to the posts and had not commented on the controversy on Twitter. Michaels issued a statement late Wednesday on social media on behalf of herself and Harper, saying, "Bob and I want to take a moment to congratulate all of the BL contestants on their hard work. We're not comfortable commenting on Rachel's journey because (we) weren't her trainers and weren't given an opportunity to work with her at any point. Any questions about the contestants on the Biggest Loser should be directed to the show's producers." Asked by another Twitter user whether she was concerned about Frederickson's weight, Michaels posted, "We won't comment because we had nothing to do with it and want no part in shaming someone with 'public statements.'"
